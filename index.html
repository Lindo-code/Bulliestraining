            <h3>WHO AM I?</h3>
            <p id="text1">
              A good question, don't you think? I am Andrea Joubert, born in 1971 and I grew up with many types of animals,having had the priveledge of living on a small holding. My favourite animal has always been the wolf. Therefore it was easy to love a dog. We always had about 5 dogs at a time as we had the space to keep them.The dogs taught me about pack behaviour, the way dogs communicate, hierarchy and Leadership. They taught me about canine body language and also how to successfully train them.

              AylaObviously I grew up, got married, owned more dogs who taught me more, and then I acquired a very special little white Bull Terrier bitch that I named Ayla's White Flash (1997 - 2011). She was not my first Bull Terrier but she is the most special dog I have had the privilege to own. She is also the founder of my Dog Training Institute, the instigator to get me to study and research all about dog obedience training, behaviour and almost everything there is to know about dogs to such an extent that I am now fully qualified in Dog Behaviour and Obedience Training, making me a fully fledged Canine Health Ethologist.

            <p id="text1">
              <span style="font-weight: italics;">definition: Health Ethology is the scientific study of the needs of domestic animals in their usual environment</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              The Health Ethologist aims to place the animal's needs in balance with its environment. Please note that although I specialise with the English Bull Terrier breed I am not exclusive to them, but rather I am very knowledgeable about most breeds and my methodology is geared to train them all. I am also constantly researching about dogs, be it behaviour, nutritional needs, health, genetics, you name it and I have probably researched it, or will be doing so very soon

                I am also the proud author of "The Bull Terrier Training Manual" 1st & 2nd Edition (now off print due to printer/publisher issues) and also "Successfully Raising & Training the Dog" which is an adapted version of the Bull Terrier Training Manual but applicable to all breeds with some extra chapters such as The Guard Dog. I will be updating and editing these books so they will not be on sale for some time. I have learnt so much in the past several years that I really feel this information needs to be added. I will update this page accordingly.
